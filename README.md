# Project Overview

The task at hand was assigned by Learnigence Technologies, involving the
replication of a specified image file. In pursuit of enhancing the user
experience (UX/UI), I have conscientiously minimized the use of `<img>` tags in
favor of scalable vector graphics (SVGs).

Notably, the envisioned user interface represents an online classroom
facilitating interaction between faculty and students. It is imperative to note
that, given the time constraints, the integration of camera and microphone
access features has not been realized in the current iteration of the project.

Despite this limitation, I have concurrently developed an alternative project,
the details of which can be accessed through the provided link. Your
consideration of the supplementary project is greatly appreciated.
